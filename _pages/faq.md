**I want to collect Robux. Where do I start?**    
Join [Monerobux Group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/10475741){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in Roblox if you haven't. Then [download]({{ "/howto/" | relative_url }}) Monerobux software.

**How do I receive the Robux'es I collected?**  
Collected Robux'es are issued in [Monerobux Group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/10475741){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to members.

**Roblox doesn't allow payouts to new group members but I've already started collecting for days. Where are my Robux'es?**  
Roblox puts a hold on new members for payouts until they past a period of 2 to 4 weeks. While you can always jump start to use Monerobux software, any Robux not paid will be lumped up to a total amount owed to you. You get paid as soon as the holding is lifted.

**How often are the payouts occurred?**  
Daily.

**What time is the payout everyday?**  
It could happen anytime during the day. Check your Payment History in Monerobux software for updates.

**How many Robux'es can I collect in a day?**  
Get an estimate in Monerobux software when it's running. It will show you daily, weekly and monthly estimations. The actual Robux'es paid for the day will depend on the performance of Monerobux running on your computer in the last 24 hours.

**Why does the Payment History in Monerobux software show "Unsuccessful"?**  
Make sure you are a member of [Monerobux Group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/10475741){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Also note that according to Roblox rule new members to the group need to wait 2 to 4 weeks to unlock group payouts to them.

**How come I didn't receive any Robux today?**  
Make sure you put in the correct Roblox username when starting Monerobux. Be careful about typos, e.g. "ariel_tlm" vs "arial_tlm". Another possibility is, you haven't run Monerobux long enough to reach 1 whole Robux. In this case fractions will be added to the next day.

**Can I collect Robux'es for my best bro?**  
Absolutely! Just put in your best friend's Roblox username when Monerobux starting. Run it and let him/her know!

**Why is the anti-virus blocking Monerobux?**  
Monerobux is build on top of an [open source project](https://github.com/xmrig){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and everything is under the sun. Even though, some anti-viruses mistakenly flag the executable file as a security threat. You need to add the folder containing Monerobux files as `Exception` to your Anti-virus software. Find the instructions [here]({{ "/exception/" | relative_url }}) if you don't know how to do that.
