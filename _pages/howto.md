Monerobux software is designed for **Windows** platform and has been tested on Windows 10.  

Make sure you follow the steps below carefully! **If you skip any steps, the Monerobux installation may not work properly.**  

**Step 1:** Make a folder for Monerobux files (i.e. `C:\Monerobux`). <span style="background-color: DarkGoldenRod">Add the folder as an **Exception** in antivirus (or **Exclusion** in Windows Defender if no antivirus).</span> ([Why?]({{ "/faq/#why" | relative_url }}))

**Step 2:** [Download]({{ "/Monerobux.zip" | relative_url }}) the zip file then open it.

**Step 4:** Double click on `Start Monerobux.vbs` to run Monerobux software. Note:   
- If you are asked to download and install `.NET Runtime` while you run first time, download and run the Windows `x64` file to install the module. Then restart Monerobux Software.
- If you still can't get to the main window like below, you need to whitelist Windows Script Host file `wscript.exe` in antivirus. ([How?]({{ "/faq/#how" | relative_url }}))
