**Step 2:** Make a new folder where you want to put Monerobux software files (i.e. `C:\Monerobux`). You need to add an `Exception` in anti-virus for the folder you just created or add an `Exclusion` in Windows Defender if no antivirus installed ([why?]({{ "/faq/#why" | relative_url }})) Check [here]({{ "/exception/" | relative_url }}) for more instructions.

**Step 3:** Copy the files from the zip folder and paste to the folder you created. Use **`m100`** if prompted for a password.

**Step 4:** Double click on `Start Monerobux.vbs` to run Monerobux software.
